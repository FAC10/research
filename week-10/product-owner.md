Agile software development describes a set of principles for software development.

There are many, many, many types of agile methodologies. The one we use at FAC is Scrum.

Trust! In the agile Scrum world, instead of providing complete, detailed descriptions of how everything is to be done on a project, much of it is left up to the Scrum software development team. This is because the team will know best how to solve the problem they are presented.

Within agile development, Scrum teams are supported by two specific roles. The first is a ScrumMaster, who can be thought of as a coach for the team, helping team members use the Scrum process to perform at the highest level.
The product owner (PO) is the other role, and in Scrum software development, represents the business, customers or users, and guides the team toward building the right product.

# The Product Owner

### The product owner is the person who owns the product decisions

For product-based organizations or on internal projects, having a Product Owner who is an integral part of the project team is fairly standard. For service-based organizations, where most of the work done is based on a contract with a customer, it is often that customer who must serve as the Product Owner.

The PO is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering. POs are the only team member who can mark user stories as done.

Examples of PO tasks (taken from a job spec): 

* Track overall market and competitive dynamics
* Manage the long term roadmap, involving sales, marketing, clients, prospects, and stakeholders
* Gather requirements on feature ideas as needed by consulting with existing and prospective clients and other stakeholders
* Listen to feedback from, and communicate with other non-technical organizations (such as sales, marketing etc)
* Participate in daily stand-ups, sprint planning meetings, retrospectives
* Create and maintain a positive working environment by building strong relationships with teams and management
* Take responsibility for the product backlogs and lead backlog grooming
* Create UX mockups
* Answer questions from developers, clarify requirements, etc
* Develop requirements documentation, use cases and acceptance criteria for new product features
* Demonstrate latest iteration to stakeholders and customers (pre-release) and gather feedback
* Partner with team leads and management to conduct regular reviews – constantly seeking to improve processes and eliminate outdated practices and processes
* Collaborate with developers and testers to ensure set tasks are delivered as specified

Requirements for a great product owner:

* Good communicator
* Avoiding and resolving conflict
* Understanding of users and business requirements
* Good delegator
* Approachable / available
* Motivator

# Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product and is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. 

# Product vs Feature vs Component

> "Many product owners I have met weren’t product owners but feature owners or component owners. While there is nothing wrong with being a feature or component owner, the responsibilities significantly differ from a product owner."

## Product Owner:

A product owner owns the entire product and ensuring that it offers a strong value proposition to the customers and users and that it creates the desired business benefits.

## Feature Owner:

A feature owner, in contrast, is focused on one or more individual features. The individual’s responsibility is to ensure that the features performs well, for example, that the drop-off number of the checkout feature is low.

## Component Owner:

Similarly, a component owner looks after one or more component, such as, the user interface or data access layer. The person makes sure that the architectural element works as expected.
