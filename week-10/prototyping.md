# Prototyping Tools

## Research Questions:
1. What is a wireframe?
2. What is a prototype?
3. Can you come up with ideas for different methods for prototyping?

### Difference between wireframes and prototypes

- A **wireframe** should answer the questions:

> _'How does the product look?'_

> _'What information does the product present?'_

- A **prototype** should answer the questions:

> _'How do I interact with the product?'_

> _'How will the product be used?'_
_

Wireframing
===

Creating a wireframe is one of the first steps you should take before designing a website.

A wireframe helps you **organize and simplify the elements and content within a website** and is an essential tool in the development process.

A wireframe is basically a **visual representation of content layout in a website design**.

### Prototype

Typically refers to an interactive prototype of some kind which allows users to navigate from page to page and use functionality such as drop down menus.

#### Advantages

Typically a website prototype will go through a few rounds of usability testing where it is constantly refined until the project team is confident it can progress to the next phase of development.

- Saves time and money.
- Avoids making wrong assumptions without testing
- The key reason for creating the prototype is to get feedback from stakeholders and users to make sure it is going in the right direction
- It allows you to fix any areas which receive negative feedback, and it allows for discussion about what is really needed in the final build and what could be removed, which can save a huge amount of money in development later on in the project.
- A website prototype can be an excellent specification document for designers and developers (a lengthy functional specification document is often difficult to interpret and difficult to engage with, but a fully interactive prototype allows them to visualise what is needed quickly and easily.
- The cost of having to make changes to a fully developed website can be much larger than the time needed for prototyping.

#### Disadvantages

- Takes more time to plan the project before actual development can start
- Some project managers and stakeholders get uncomfortable that the project will not meet deadlines (however, if planned in properly the time to create a prototype is minimal and can often save time down the line by making sure the developers are clear on exactly what they need to create)
- Difficult to decide which prototyping method or tool to choose.

## Software Prototyping

Refers to building software application prototypes which displays the functionality of the product under development, but may not actually hold the exact logic of the original software.

Prototyping is used to allow the users evaluate developer proposals and try
them out before implementation.

### A Stepwise approach to designing a software prototype
#### Basic Requirement Identification
This step involves understanding the very basic produc requirements in terms
of user interface. Intricate details of internal design and aspects like
performance etc. can be ignored at this stage.

#### Developing the initial prototype
Very basic requirements are showcased and user interfaces are provided, these
features may not exactly work in the same manner internally in the actual
softwared developed. Workarounds are used to give the same look and feel to
the customer in the prototype developed.

#### Review of the Prototype
The prototype os presented to the customer and other important stakeholders.
Feedback is collected in an organized manner an used to further enhance the
product.

### Types of Software Prototyping
There are different types of software prototypes used in the industry. Following are the major software prototyping types used widely −

#### Throwaway/Rapid Prototyping
Throwaway prototyping is also called as rapid or close ended prototyping. This type of prototyping uses very little effort with minimum requirement analysis to build a prototype. Once the actual requirements are understood, the prototype is discarded and the actual system is developed with a much clear understanding of user requirements.

#### Evolutionary Prototyping
Evolutionary prototyping also called as breadboard prototyping is based on building actual functional prototypes with minimal functionality in the beginning. The prototype developed forms the heart of the future prototypes on top of which the entire system is built. By using evolutionary prototyping, the well-understood requirements are included in the prototype and the requirements are added as and when they are understood.

#### Incremental Prototyping
Incremental prototyping refers to building multiple functional prototypes of the various sub-systems and then integrating all the available prototypes to form a complete system.

#### Extreme Prototyping
Extreme prototyping is used in the web development domain. It consists of three sequential phases. First, a basic prototype with all the existing pages is presented in the HTML format. Then the data processing is simulated using a prototype services layer. Finally, the services are implemented and integrated to the final prototype. This process is called Extreme Prototyping used to draw attention to the second phase of the process, where a fully functional UI is developed with very little regard to the actual services.

### Protoptying tools
A prototype is an early sample, model or release of a product built to test a concept or process to make sure it is fit for the audience and purpose.
(So it is the initial version of your tech product).

The prototype allows you to explore your ideas and show the intention behind a feature or the overall design concept to users. It can be anything from paper drawings (low-fidelity) to a fully functioning site (high-fidelity).

## Benefits of Prototypes
It's a lot cheaper to change a prodcuct early in the development process than to make a change after you have developed a fully functioning product. It is therefore recommended to build prototypes early in the development process. Prototyping also allows you to gather feedback from users while you are still in the planning and designing your product.

Nielsen has found that the biggest improvements in UX comes from gathering data as early as possible.

## Importance of Prototyping and Testing
 Some products are appropriate for one audience, but not necessarily for another. This is why you need to use reviewers to evaluate your product, because they will be able ot give you feedback. So prototyping and testing is important, because it will show if your product is suitable for your target audience. The feedback you receive from your reviewers will help you improve your product.

## Methods of prototyping
Software prototyping has many variants, but all of the methods are based on two major forms:

## Throwaway prototyping
This refers to the creation of a product which will eventually be discarded rather than become part of the the final product. With this approach the product, which is usually a small part of the system is given to the end user to try out and evaluate.

The user then provides feedback which can quickly be incorporated into the development of the main system.

The main objective of this is to ensure that the system requirements are validated and they're clearly understood.

- The full system/product is being developed alongside the prototypes and incorporates the neccessary changes.

The advantage of this approach is the speed with which the prototype is put together. It also focuses the user on only one aspect of the system so keeping their feedback precise.
One disadvantage with throw-away prototyping is that developers may be pressurised by the users to deliver it as a final system! Another issue is that all the man-hours of putting together the throw away prototypes are lost unlike the evolutionary approach. But the benefits may outweigh the disadvantages.

## Evolutionary prototyping
The main goal is to build a very robust prototype in a structured manner and constantly refine it. When built, it forms the heart of the new system.

So the initial prototype is presented to the user. They provide feedback and suggestions for improvements.
These are actioned by the developer who then presents a more refined prototype. The user once more provides feedback. The process is repeated.
So at each stage the prototype 'evolves' towards the final system.


The advantages of evolutionary prototyping are:
- The delivery of the system is speeded up
- The user engages with the system
- The system is more likely to meet the user requirements


A problem with evolutionary prototyping is knowing when it is necessary to stop tweaking the system and actually finish the development.

## Prototypes & Web Development: The Process

A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from. (Wikipedia)

Doing this rapidly and iteratively generates feedback early and often in the process, improving the final design and reducing the need for changes during development. (Lyndon Cerejo, [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/design-better-faster-with-rapid-prototyping/))

The old adage, “a picture speaks a thousand words” captures what user interface prototyping is all about: using visuals to describe thousands of words’ worth of design and development specifications that detail how a system should behave and look. In an iterative approach to user interface design, rapid prototyping is the process of quickly mocking up the future state of a system, be it a website or application, and validating it with a broader team of users, stakeholders, developers and designers. (Cerejo)

### How to Rapidly Prototype Websites (This is just one way of working, courtesy of a [Treehouse article](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/rapidly-prototype-websites)) :pencil:

- Start with a pencil and paper. There are several advantages: it's cheap and quick, you don't get overly invested, it allows for maximum flexibility. Paper sketches should mark down the big ideas, without any attention to details like colours and fonts.

- Then move onto a digital mockup. [Balsamique Mockups](https://balsamiq.com/) and [Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) are good options and both have free trials. Balsamique is particularly useful for adding web widgets. Digital mockups are helpful in general because they can be shared easily. Each level of rapid prototyping should escalate the detail. The aesthetic at this stage should just be a simple wireframe without any colouration. The focus is on proportion, spacing, and alignment; it can be hard to get these elements right on paper.

- Skip Photoshop etc. (if you can). Photoshop, Illustrator, GIMP, Pixelmator, and similar high-fidelity tools typically intend to provide maximum detail. Some say they are less efficient for creating simple designs because of this. Also the pixels will also never line up the same way in a browser, especially when it comes to responsive design or cross-browser inconsistencies. Sometimes, though, it is helpful to go into more depth at this stage in the design process, so you might require Illustrator to create more detailed imagery. Tools like [inVision](https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730415-What-is-the-Free-Plan-) are also good for making interactive mockups to get a feel for the flow of interaction.

-  Prototype the GUI so that it works in a web browser. You can just use HTML for this. Start with placeholder elements. Once you're happy with this, add as much real data/content as you can. The way that information is displayed may inform the design decisions made at this stage.

- Finish up. The wonderful thing about prototyping the GUI is that it often just becomes the real site, with structure and styling already in place.

### The cheapest options that we found :dollar:

- If you prefer using pencil and paper for mockups, there are some great UI stencils.
- inVision is [free](https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730415-What-is-the-Free-Plan-) if you're only working on one prototype at a time
- [Moqups](https://moqups.com/web/landing?utm_expid=100030427-10.DlsdnCC0S_yiVKohsi4CHw.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.uk%2F) is a free wireframing platform
- HTML, CSS
