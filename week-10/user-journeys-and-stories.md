# User Journeys and User Stories

## What is the difference between a Journey and a Story?

#### What is a user _journey_?

  1. A user journey is a series of steps which demonstrates a scenario which how a user _might_ interact with the thing you are designing. They're typically used in two ways:
    - demonstrates the way users _currently_ interact with the product
    - demonstrates the way users _could_ interact with the product


  2. Why do I make a user story?
    - It helps _demonstrates the vision for the project_ - They show an example of what the future state of whatever it is you are designing could be. Along with personas (we'll talk about this later) they can be one of the key outputs from the requirements gathering stage at the beginning of a project.

    - They help us _understand user behavior_ â€“ User journeys can help you work out how users are going to interact with your system and what they expect from it.

    - They help _identify possible functionality at a high level_ â€“ by understanding the key tasks the users will want achieve, you can start to understand what sort of functional requirements will help enable those tasks.

    - They help you _define your taxonomy and interface_ â€“ By understanding the â€˜flowâ€™ of the various tasks the user will want to undertake you can start to think about what sort of taxonomy can help support those tasks and what kind of interface the user will be needing to accomplish them.

    Side note: wtf is taxonomy? ðŸ¤”

    Basically, using a sitemap that serves as a hierarchical diagram showing the structure of a website or application. They are used by User Experience Designers and Information Architects to define the _taxonomy_ through grouping of related content.
