## What are user stories?

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:

“As a **_type of user_**, I want **_some goal_** so that **_some reason_**.”

"As **_persona_**, I want **_what?_** so that **_why?_**."

## What is an epic?

One of the benefits of agile user stories is that they can be written at varying levels of detail. We can write a user story to cover large amounts of functionality. These large user stories are generally known as *epics*. Here is an epic agile user story example from a desktop backup product:
_As a user, I can backup my entire hard drive._

Because an *epic* is generally too large for an agile team to complete in one iteration, it is split into multiple smaller user stories before it is worked on. The epic above could be split into dozens (or possibly hundreds), including these two:

_As a user, I can specify files or folders to backup based on file size, date created and date modified._
_As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn't filled up with things I don't need saved._

## What is a theme?

Themes may be thought of as groups of related stories. Often the stories all contribute to a common goal or are related in some obvious way.

## How to make use of personas in your projects

Get the maximum use out of your personas. You might use your personas to:

- Brainstorm features – Take it in turns to role play as your personas and think of what features he or she would find useful.
- Prioritise features – If you’ve got a bunch of features then you can use your personas to help priorities them. Got through each feature and discuss whether each persona would love, like, loath or be non-fussed about it. By giving a score for each you can, and perhaps weighting personas depending on their importance you can rank your quickly features by user preference (well best guess anyway).
- Drive scenarios and designs – Use your personas as a basis for your scenarios, designs and user journeys. What context would Jake be using your application? What would he need to do? How might it work for him?
- Evaluate and test designs – If you’ve got a design then take a persona and think about how he or she would react and interact with that design. Would Sarah know what to do? Would this design be clean and clear enough for Mark?
- Role-play – Everyone loves a bit of role playing so put your persona’s hat on (metaphorically although it could be literally) and pretend to be them . You could do some quick user testing by asking someone to role play a persona (or even better hypnotising them) and asking them to carry out some tasks.
- Help recruit participants for user testing – Persona make a great starting point for recruiting participants for user testing. You can use your persona to define the sort of participants you need, or even give your personas to your recruitment company and ask for 3 Peters, 2 Johns and 3 Marinas!
