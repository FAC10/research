#### What is a user _journey_?


1.  A user journey is a series of steps which demonstrates a scenario which how a user _might_ interact with the thing you are designing. They're typically used in two ways:
    - demonstrates the way users _currently_ interact with the product
    - demonstrates the way users _could_ interact with the product

2.  Why do I make a user journey?
    - It helps _demonstrates the vision for the project_ - They show an example of what the future state of whatever it is you are designing could be. Along with personas (we'll talk about this later) they can be one of the key outputs from the requirements gathering stage at the beginning of a project.

    - They help us _understand user behavior_ ‚Äì User journeys can help you work out how users are going to interact with your system and what they expect from it.

    - They help _identify possible functionality at a high level_ ‚Äì by understanding the key tasks the users will want achieve, you can start to understand what sort of functional requirements will help enable those tasks.

    - They help you _define your taxonomy and interface_ ‚Äì By understanding the ‚Äòflow‚Äô of the various tasks the user will want to undertake you can start to think about what sort of taxonomy can help support those tasks and what kind of interface the user will be needing to accomplish them.

    Side note: wtf is taxonomy? ü§î

    Basically, using a sitemap that serves as a hierarchical diagram showing the structure of a website or application. They are used by User Experience Designers and Information Architects to define the _taxonomy_ through grouping of related content.

3.  _When_ should I create a user journey?

  User journeys typically come towards the beginning of a project in the discovery or requirements gathering phase, normally after personas. This is both to visualize the user requirements and help feed into other design activities such as information architecture or wireframing. However, they can also be used further down the line when scoping out pieces of functionality in more detail.

4.  _How_ do I create a user journey?

  Make sure it satisfies the following requirements, at least!

  - Your user‚Äôs goals
  - Their motivations
  - Their current pain points
  - Their overall character
  - The main tasks they want to achieve

  User journeys tie back to _personas_ (again, we'll talk about this soon!) and real people. You will want to create at least one journey for each of your primary personas at a _bare minimum_!

5. _What_ should a user journey contain?

  You will want to think broadly in each step about things such as:

  - **Context** ‚Äì Where is the user? What is around them? Are there any - external factors which may be distracting them?
  - **Progression** ‚Äì How does each step enable them to get to the next?
  - **Devices** ‚Äì what device are they using? Are they a novice or expert? - What features does the device have?
  - **Functionality** ‚Äì What type of functionality are they expecting? Is it - achievable?
  - **Emotion** ‚Äì What is their emotional state in each step? Are they engaged, bored, annoyed?

## What are user stories?

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:

‚ÄúAs a **_type of user_**, I want **_some goal_** so that **_some reason_**.‚Äù

"As **_persona_**, I want **_what?_** so that **_why?_**."

## What is an epic?

One of the benefits of agile user stories is that they can be written at varying levels of detail. We can write a user story to cover large amounts of functionality. These large user stories are generally known as *epics*. Here is an epic agile user story example from a desktop backup product:
_As a user, I can backup my entire hard drive._

Because an *epic* is generally too large for an agile team to complete in one iteration, it is split into multiple smaller user stories before it is worked on. The epic above could be split into dozens (or possibly hundreds), including these two:

_As a user, I can specify files or folders to backup based on file size, date created and date modified._
_As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn't filled up with things I don't need saved._

## What is a theme?

Themes may be thought of as groups of related stories. Often the stories all contribute to a common goal or are related in some obvious way.


## What is a user persona?

### Why do I need a user persona?

<img width="auto" src="./../images/user-journey-persona-nerd-coder.jpg" />

- we need help in making key design and functionality decisions during the UX process
- we need help when talking with our clients about what the user experience should be like
- we need help in creating realistic user journeys


### Who is the persona ?

<img width="auto" src="./../images/user-journey-persona-talk.png" />

- based on real users
- represents a particular audience segment
- based on various types of qualitative and quantitative research
- known motivations, frustrations (i.e. who they are)


### When to create a persona?

- create a persona during the initial discovery phase of your app.


### How do I create a persona?

- speak with your client ‚Äì they will often have some information or insights about their audience in the form of marketing information, previous research and customer groups. However, **take this with a grain of salt as their perceptions of who their audience are may not always match the reality**.

- speaking with users ‚Äì probably one of the most valuable ways of getting good qualitative data is to speak to the people who are likely to use it. This of course means you need a vague idea of the sorts of people you need to speak to.

- bespoke analytics - for example, social media interactions (a great way of seeing what type of people are interacting with similar brands). The more you can find out the richer and more valuable your personas will be.


### What info should be included in user persona?

- picture - try not to use stock photography as this - makes it hard to think about the persona as a real life person and can be difficult in - gaining credibility.
- demographic data such as age/location
- motivations
- goals
- pain points or frustrations
- a short bio about their background
- technical ability along with which devices they use and how often
- other brands or websites they may like


### How to make use of personas in your projects

Get the maximum use out of your personas. You might use your personas to:

- Brainstorm features ‚Äì Take it in turns to role play as your personas and think of what features he or she would find useful.
- Prioritise features ‚Äì If you‚Äôve got a bunch of features then you can use your personas to help priorities them. Got through each feature and discuss whether each persona would love, like, loath or be non-fussed about it. By giving a score for each you can, and perhaps weighting personas depending on their importance you can rank your quickly features by user preference (well best guess anyway).
- Drive scenarios and designs ‚Äì Use your personas as a basis for your scenarios, designs and user journeys. What context would Jake be using your application? What would he need to do? How might it work for him?
- Evaluate and test designs ‚Äì If you‚Äôve got a design then take a persona and think about how he or she would react and interact with that design. Would Sarah know what to do? Would this design be clean and clear enough for Mark?
- Role-play ‚Äì Everyone loves a bit of role playing so put your persona‚Äôs hat on (metaphorically although it could be literally) and pretend to be them . You could do some quick user testing by asking someone to role play a persona (or even better hypnotising them) and asking them to carry out some tasks.
- Help recruit participants for user testing ‚Äì Persona make a great starting point for recruiting participants for user testing. You can use your persona to define the sort of participants you need, or even give your personas to your recruitment company and ask for 3 Peters, 2 Johns and 3 Marinas!
