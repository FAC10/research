### When to create a persona?

### How do I create a persona?

- speak with your client – they will often have some information or insights about their audience in the form of marketing information, previous research and customer groups. However, **take this with a grain of salt as their perceptions of who their audience are may not always match the reality**.

- speaking with users – probably one of the most valuable ways of getting good qualitative data is to speak to the people who are likely to use it. This of course means you need a vague idea of the sorts of people you need to speak to.

- bespoke analytics - for example, social media interactions (a great way of seeing what type of people are interacting with similar brands). The more you can find out the richer and more valuable your personas will be.
