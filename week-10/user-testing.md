# User testing

## Why?

* User testing is important because it places your product in the hands of actual users without any bias.
* Things that are intuitive and logical to the designer/developer of a product may not be intuitive to the end user.
* It can remove internal conflict within the production team by placing the product in the hands of actual users and getting feedback from them.
* You encounter and deal with usability issues before the launch of your product.

## Qualitative vs Quantitive

Qualitative research deals with emotions, human behavior, and subjective matters.

Quantitative research focuses on data and hard numbers.

In practice, both are important, and the combination of the two is important to your overall understanding of the usability of your website.
My Quantitative data might tell me how long each user took to complete a given task, or how long they spent on each page, but it doesn't tell me why they took extra time, or how that experience made them feel. <br>
Say 25% of my users took a lot longer than expected to complete a task, my Qualitative data will tell me why, through their direct feedback we can understand why it took them more time. We can also look at other data about them, what demographic are they from? Are there any correlations? <br>

## How?

* Focus Groups

  Focus groups allow you to deeply and extensively see a group of users interacting with each other to discuss an idea or concept.

* Tree Testing

 Tree Testing allows you to see how well users interact and find items or elements in the website hierarchy.

* Remote User Testing

  Remote user testing allows you to conduct testing from the comfort of your personal space, by computer or telephone.

* Beta Testing

  It allows you to roll out a product to individuals who are keen on providing an objective feedback, thus creating a win-win situation.


* User Diaries

  Ask them to simply play around and explore the product.

  ### There are many kinds of usability testing
 qualitative, quantitative, summative, formative, formal, informal, large sample, small sample, comparative tests, benchmarking tests, and on and on. They’re all valuable for different purposes.

 Quantitative testing is usually about click-through and conversion rates over a relatively large sample size.

 Qualitative testing is usually done in a less-structured format with fewer participants. Its goal is to identify the underlying sentiment, rationale or motivation of the target with respect to the advertiser’s brand, product, site and/or category.

 Formative tests provide the tester with the information they need to improve the testing (usability) process while it's happening.

 Summative tests happen at the end of a tests round to test the overall knowledge (usability) of the product.

 ### Methodology:
 1. Exploratory testing is any testing to the extent that the tester actively controls the design of the tests as those tests are performed and uses information gained while testing to design new and better tests.
 Is essentially testing without a defined script.

 2. A set of scripted test usually involves:
   * Page consistency in case of multi-page web sties.
   * Testing the database connections.
   * Testing functions with sample input to make sure they work fine (especially those that are algorithm-like).
   * Re-testing the functionalities that can be affected by the changes just made.

 Test can be also done by:
 * One-on-one interviews.
 * Usability testing (also done in a one-on-one) usually performed in controlled environment. Tasks are specifically outlined and feedback is direct.
 * Focus groups are quite defined samples of users testing a given topic.
