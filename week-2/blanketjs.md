What is code coverage?

What is it?

A code coverage library that gives you a statistic on what percentage of your code has been run through your tests.

Code coverage is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs. A program with high code coverage, measured as a percentage, has had more of its source code executed during testing which suggests it has a lower chance of containing undetected software bugs compared to a program with low code coverage.
