 Unit tests should only depend on the tested implementation unit; they should not depend on external components
 such as databases, network services, web browser interaction. When such external elements are required, unit tests use mock objects.

 Unit tests typically refer to tests that test a minimal amount of code, for example a single function.

 A unit test tests code that you have complete control over whereas an integration test tests how your code uses or "integrates" with some other code.



Black box testing – Internal system design is not considered in this type of testing. Tests are based on requirements and functionality.

White box testing – This testing is based on knowledge of the internal logic of an application’s code. Also known as Glass box Testing. Internal software and code working should be known for this type of testing. Tests are based on coverage of code statements, branches, paths, conditions.
