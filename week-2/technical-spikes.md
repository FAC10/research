#TECHNICAL SPIKES Research

##What are they? Why are they helpful? Give an example.

Definition (src=“agiledictionary.com/209/spike")
A task aimed at answering a question or gathering information, rather than at producing shippable product.
A spike is an opportunity to investigate aspects of a project during a concentrated period of time. It asks:
In what ways can we approach this problem? How long will it take? etc.
To answer these questions, it surveys the possible solutions on small parts of the codebase or on example problems, rather than committing large amounts of time to exploring the unknown.

###In other words...
A spike is an investment to make the user story
The main goal is to avoid taking risks in planning
It is a refinement activity not a development one

###Why/When to use a spike?
Build or buy situation
Feasibility. i.e. can it be done?
How long it would take to build?
User story needs further investigation To bring your entire team up to speed Technical issues that need addressing

###At what point should you use spikes?
At any point during the build
Usually before starting a sprint or phase of the project
Spikes should be used sparingly
You generally don’t want spikes to hang around very long
That’s cos if your backlog is full of spikes, it means it
is full of stuff you don’t know

##Philosophical moment:
What spikes have you used in past projects? Discuss.
How could you have used a spike to improve a previous project? Discuss.

###Top Tips
Teams should agree that every spike is, for example, never more than a day (N.B. teams should set a timeframe and stick to it)
At the end of the time period, you have to report your findings What to do next might be to define another spike
It’s best if a spike has one very clear question that needs answering, e.g. can we implement smooth scrolling in vanilla JS?
Therefore, split your spikes, just as you would user stories
Don’t do a spike on your own. You need a range of perspectives
Don’t look at just one solution. Make sure you compare at least 2 or 3 to avoid confirmation bias.
Every spike should come with a recommendation for further action that follows on from your conclusion. Be bold.

##Happy spiking!
